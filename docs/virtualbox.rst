Introduction
------------

To make it easier for non-developers to review Plone, we created this **VirtualBox Plone Appliance**.
You do not need to know anything about Operating Systems, Installer and so on.
The only application you need is Virtualbox [link].

Preparation
-----------

Please make sure that you have VirtualBox [link] installed.
